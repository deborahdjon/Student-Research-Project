# Student_Research_Project_NLP_Movie_Script_Summary

Our project, "Natural Language Processing of Movie Scripts to Analyze the Plot Content, Characters, and Their Evolution," uses advanced NLP techniques to provide an objective analysis of movies and series. Unlike subjective user reviews, our approach focuses on extracting factual insights from the script, including dialogue distribution, character development, and more. 

## Objective:
Our goal was to generate concise overviews for episodes or seasons, encompassing character lists, top three dialogue contributors, total word count, discussed topics, sentiment trends, and character speech timelines. This objective aims to provide viewers with data-driven insights, ultimately enhancing their understanding of movies and series. For comprehensive details and findings, please refer to the full research report.
To achieve this objective, we have formulated five specific hypotheses to analyse the following:

- Identify main characters based on dialogue.
- Discover prevalent topics, particularly in the science fiction genre.
- Examine gender-based speech differences and topic preferences.
- Track individual character dialogue changes across seasons.
- Assess character sentiment to maintain a neutral tone.
- The goal is to provide data-driven episode or season overviews, enhancing viewer understanding. For details, refer to the full report.

## Methodology
Our project's methodology combines domain expertise, data acquisition, exploration, and modeling to provide objective insights into movie and series scripts. We followed a structured process, based on the [Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spss-modeler/18.1.1?topic=dm-crisp-help-overview). These were the steps we followed:

1. Formulate Hypotheses: We begin by defining hypotheses and objectives, a fundamental step in understanding the scope of the project.
2. Acquiring Data: Data is collected from movie and series scripts available on https://imsdb.com via web scraping. The data is organized in 3. a suitable format for analysis.
4. Explore Data: Data exploration involves querying, visualization, and reporting to gain a better understanding of the dataset and to detect potential errors.
5. Prepare Data: Data preparation involves cleaning the dataset, including the removal of irrelevant text elements and the transformation of text data into a usable format.
6. Modelling: In the modelling phase, we employ various techniques to process the data and answer the formulated hypotheses. Machine learning algorithms, such as the Bag of Words (BoW) model, are used to analyze text data.
7. Evaluation: The final phase assesses the quality of the model and ensures that it addresses the research hypotheses. If necessary, adjustments are made to enhance the model's performance.

## Results:
Our analysis reveals the need for an objective instance to evaluate movies and series, distinct from subjective reviews that vary based on individual opinions. In summary, we discovered the following:

- Main character detection based on speech quantity was inconclusive as some main characters communicate non-verbally.
- The assumption that script topics align with the science-fiction genre was rejected.
- While men tend to speak more than women, their topic distribution is similar.
- Character speech patterns vary across seasons, affirming the fourth hypothesis.
- Characters typically exhibit a neutral sentiment, with sentiment analysis confirming this hypothesis.
- The generated overviews include character lists, top dialogue contributors, total word count, sentiment trends, and topic distributions, enhancing user understanding of episodes or seasons.
